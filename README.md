# M-Ar
Experimental 32-bit hardware emulator

## What the flibidy does the name mean?
- `M`: Machina series (if there even will be one lmao)
- `Ar`: Argon

### Why "Argon"?
Argon is inert, stable and abundant in the air. It fits for the first implementation of the Machina series, used as a base/reference for next ones (if there will be any)

## Who/what is M-Ar for?
- Educational/experimental purposes (mainly)
- For me to learn CPU architecture
- For anybody who hates themselves

## How do I make programs for M-Ar? (please dont if you love yourself)
Make a `.mar` file, then... idk man just write a program?

## Where can I find documentation?
You don't... (you're lucky if you can understand the codebase)
